# Cybersecurity Workshops Slides 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity training slides originally developed for multi-day workshops. These materials were created as part of my previous role, where I led the design and development of both cybersecurity content and solutions.

While the company has since shifted its focus to AI and benched the series, Iâ€™ve received permission to release **modified versions** of the slides here. 

Note: These were developed in the later part of 2024, while they provide a solid foundation; after studying these, you should look up recent attacks and case studies to know of the latest trends (for each audience separately).
